\item The tablenotes or figurenotes environments may be used below tables
or figures, respectively, as demonstrated below.

\item If you have difficulties with the mathtime package, adjust the package
options appropriately for your platform. If you can't get it to work, just
remove the package or see our technical support document online (please
refer to the author instructions).

\item If you are using an appendix, it goes last, after the bibliography.
Use regular section headings to make the appendix headings.

\item If you are not using an appendix, you may delete the appendix command
and sample appendix section heading.

\item Either the natbib package or the harvard package may be used with bibtex.
To include one of these packages, uncomment the appropriate usepackage command
above. Note: you can't use both packages at once or compile-time errors will result.

\end{itemize}
